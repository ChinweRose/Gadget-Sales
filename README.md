## Sales Analysis for the purchase of different devices for the year 2019

### What is this project about?

This project intends to make an analysis from the data provided and make valuable conclusions about the sales rate of different devices bought from the company for the year 2019.


### Data Sources

The data was sourced  from "MeriSkill Sales Data Table", which I intend to provide meaningful conclusions and create a well-detailed visualization from the data.

### Tools used

- Excel - Where I cleaned my data.
- Power BI - I transformed my data and created my report.

### Processes during the analysis

- I loaded the data and made sure there were no blank spaces present.
- I cleaned the data using Power Query and merged necessary tables to overcome ambiguity.
- Data cleaning and formatting were done.
- I designed my dashboard with the reports.


### Exploratory Data Analysis

After the analysis, these were the core questions that needed to be answered.

- What is the pattern like?
- What product has the highest demand?
- What month of the year has the peak sale?
- Why are there more demands for a particular product from a particular city?
- How do we implement a customer segmentation strategy for high-lifetime value customers?
- How do we create more awareness for other less-bought products?


### Conclusions made from the analysis.

1. The graph above illustrates the total number of products ordered which is 209,000 and the total sales made from the products which is $34.49M. It is noteworthy that the least sales happened in the first month(January), with a total sale of $1.82M, approximately 5% of the total amount of sales. There was a steady rise in sales from the first month till the fourth month, then a significant drop in sales was noticed in the fifth month(May). December happened to have recorded the highest sales, making up 13% of the total amount of sales.

2. Also, from this visualization here, major sales were recorded in San Francisco, with a total number of 44732 devices bought, and $8,262,203 total sales made. From observation, we noticed that the Macbook Pro laptop topped the list of the most-bought products making up 23.4% of the total sales made in San Francisco, 22.5% of total sales made in Los Angeles, 22.3% of total sales made in New York City, and 20.8% of the total sales made in Boston, with the remaining devices making up to less than 10% of the total sales across the cities.

### Recommendations

- Generate a high level of product awareness for devices with lesser sales.
- Invest in marketing and promoting the products during the peak sales seasons, and focus on expanding the most-bought devices in cities with higher profit margins.
